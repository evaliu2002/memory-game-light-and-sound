**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Eva Liu**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [x] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

 I google searched the RGB code for the color lilac, Javascript Math.random, the setInterval clearInterval methods,
 how to make a button background an image, and how to make buttons round using CSS.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge that I encountered was programming through Javascript since I wasn't used to 
 some of the Javascript syntax as I usually program using Java, it took me a short while to be able to type up parts of my code.
 I overcame this challenge through practicing getting used to Javascript syntax by searching up about Javascript
 syntax and reading more about it.
 Another challenge was when I was implementing the random pattern generator. I assumed that implementing a random number
 generator in Javascript was different than Java due to Javascript variables and objects. I was stuck for 40 minutes
 wondering why the number generator wasn't inputting numbers into my pattern array until I realized that I just forgot
 the parenthesis after Math.random when I was comparing my code with examples online.
 It was funny but also really frustrating after I finished debugging.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Questions I have about web development is how I would be able to host a website after I finished implementing
 the website locally. I have worked with the spark Java framework before, but I am unsure of how to host a
 website through a bought domain and if I need to use my own servers to host. ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, ]
